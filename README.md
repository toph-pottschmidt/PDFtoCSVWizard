# Introduction

PDFtoCSVWizard is a tool designed for overhauling data-entry from PDFs to CSVs by simply clicking on texts, and working upward to powerful abstractions like templating rows and (coming soon) pages.

# Use

This tool should be published at https://toph-pottschmidt.github.io/PDFtoCSVWizard/ if you would just like to use it.

# Local development, installation, contributing, etc.

Ensure you have the latest version of Node, This application was developed with version 23.11. I suggest Volta to handle npm versioning if you don't already have a solution.

```
git clone git@github.com:toph-pottschmidt/PDFtoCSVWizard.git
cd PDFtoCSVWizard
npm ci
npm run dev
```
